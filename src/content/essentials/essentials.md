## Distance Learning

Over the course of five instructor-led sessions, participants will be led through a live presentation of the session content. Following the live presentation, participants will be provided with learning materials including hands-on coding activities. These activities can be done on your own or you can join one of our proctor-led in-person sessions at multiple IBM sites. This course is geared to developers who are working in the front-end or UI layer, regardless of their role. Upon completion of this course, participats will be awarded a digital badge.

## Classroom Immersive

Week-long in-person immersive learning enabling product teams to get up and running quickly using the Design System. Beginning in July, 2019, we will conduct classroom immersive workshops. In this week-long session, product teams will be led through the material delivered in the Distance Learning sessions and will begin implementing the Design System into their actual product UI. This course is geared to developers who are working in the front-end or UI layer, regardless of their role. We will work with you to schedule the week-long event at your location.
